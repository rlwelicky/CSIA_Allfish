## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(kableExtra)
library(knitr)
load("models.Rdata")
glmmTable <- function(glmmTMBobject, AAtype, filename){
  rawtab <- summary(glmmTMBobject)$coefficients$cond
  rownames(rawtab) <- c("Intercept","scale(year)", "scale(sl)")
  # Making the table
  rawtab[c(2:3),c(1:4)] %>% 
    kbl(col.names = c("Estimate", "Standard Error", "z-value","p-value"), 
        digits=c(3,3,3,3), 
        align = "c") %>% 
    kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, 
                  html_font = "Times New Roman") %>% 
    save_kable(file = filename, self_contained = T) 
}

glmmTable(glusole,"Glu_Sole", "glu_sole.html")
glmmTable(phesole,"Phe_Sole", "phe_sole.html")
glmmTable(tpsole,"TP_Sole", "tp_sole.html")
glmmTable(gluhake,"Glu_Hake", "glu_hake.html")
glmmTable(phehake,"Phe_Hake", "phe_hake.html")
glmmTable(tphake,"TP_Hake", "tp_hake.html")
glmmTable(glupollock,"Glu_pollock", "glu_pollock.html")
glmmTable(phepollock,"Phe_pollock", "phe_pollock.html")
glmmTable(tppollock,"TP_pollock", "tp_pollock.html")
glmmTable(gluherring,"Glu_herring", "glu_herring.html")
glmmTable(pheherring,"Phe_herring", "phe_herring.html")
glmmTable(tpherring,"TP_herring", "tp_herring.html")
glmmTable(glurock,"Glu_rock", "glu_rock.html")
glmmTable(pherock,"Phe_rock", "phe_rock.html")
glmmTable(tprock,"TP_rock", "tp_rock.html")
```
## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
